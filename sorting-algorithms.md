Whats the quickest relationship?,O(1) or O(n^2)
Give an example of an O(1) task?,cleaning the hose for a party
Give an example of an O(1) array function?,getting the first value from an array
Order the 6 Big O relationships?,O(1) - O(log n) - o(n) - O(n log n) - O(n^2) - O(n!)
Whay's a class Big O that is an improvement on O(n)?,O(log n).
What sort of algorithms are O(log n)?,Divide and conquer
With Big O do we care about small cases?,no we're thinking of the scale rate - what would it be like with a million 0 thousands- trillions
What is linear growth in O notation?,O(n)
Give an example for dinner parties of O(n)?,the time it takes to pass the tofu around the table.
Give an example for of O(n)?,the time it takes to pass the tofu around the table.
Give an example with arrays for of O(n)?,add up all elements in an array
What is often an improvement on O(n^2) problems?,O(n log n)
Give a sorting algorithm which is O(n log n)?,merge sort.
What is bubble sort in Big O?,O(n^2)
What are nested loops working over the same collection again in Big O?,O(n^2)
What big O is going through every combination of playing cards?,O(n!) <- factorial
What is bubble sort?,go along the line comparing two at a time. If the final array is the same as the start then you're finished.
What is insertion sort?,You put one thing in the middle. Get a second. See if it goes left or right.
What is merge sort stage 1?,O(n) - split until you have singular parts.
What is merge sort stage 2?,O(log n) - Merge your lists back together. Get the smallest numbers from the two groups being merged. COmpare. Place the smallest one in. Then compare the next two smallest. Repeat.

Simplify in Big O  O(n * 3)?,O(n)
Simplify in Big O  O(n^2 + 3)?,O(n^2)
Simplify in Big O  O(n! + n^ 2)?,O(n!)
