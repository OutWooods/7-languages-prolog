## What is this?

This is week three from the book '7 Languages in 7 weeks'. In it you learn 7 languages...in seven weeks.
Week 3 is Prolog.

Each of my folders for this book follow a similar structure. There are 'dumps' where I just put largely unformatted notes down as I go. There are 'anki' files which contain questions and answers for me to memorise and there are 'questions' files which are where I do the exercises from the book and add annotations to the code.

I tried to follow a cycle of learn (aka the dump files), do (the questions files) and then memorise (the anki files).

Then each week I write up some notes on learning the language, what its taught me, and also write an article on learning - linking what I experienced doing this to research on how memory actually works.

## Why Seven Languages?

A common (and in my view) right tip to novice coders is to learn one language and learn it well. This is great, but now I've got slightly more experienced, I think going from a more indepth approach to a breadth focused approach can help you understand the percularities of the language you've learnt, and make you more aware of its flaws and benefits.

For me, I've only worked with OO design styles in imperative languages (JS, PhP and Ruby). And I like this paradigm, but I cannot truely say its the best because I've tried no other approches. I probably assume alot about how languages work, because thats how Ruby/PhP/JS do it which are not the case.

So the jarring nature of dealing with totally different approaches, and my word, Prolog certainly is different, will help me see the pros and cons of each. I think Prolog particularly has challenged alot of my base assumptions about code - and has forced me to think more about recursion, but also why imperative coding is *only* one approach. 

## Learning?

But beyond this doing the book, is also about improving my ability to learn. Often I've found I've learnt something, done it well and then months later its basically all gone. So I'm using anki cards slow down my pace, but that improve my long term retention. The reflection articles are also that - ingraining a more self aware approach into my learning, even if that means it's less quick.

Another reason for doing seven languages - is I'm a big believer (after reading the research) in the idea that learning is heavily based on knowledge, and the more knowledge you have, the more quickly you can pick up new knowledge - because you have a pre-existing schema (basically network of ideas) to fit ideas into. In more human terms, you learn new stuff quicker the more you know about a topic, because you have more things in your memory to hook a new fact onto.

So I want to see if learning all these languages, their principals and ideas, makes me better at picking up new ideas, and more flexible in my approach.

The articles on learning are a way for me to think about how we learn to code, and connect that back to what research actually says about learning to code. And hopefully make me consider how to better teach it too. I'd like, perhaps, in the long term to build some sort of course for newbies, which focuses more on understanding and knowledge - and see if this helps new programmers.
