Pre-testing effect

Pretesting is when you give a quiz on a topic before teaching on that topic. Aka asking answers to questions that learners do not know the answers. 
It's pretty counter intuative that this would have any value. Classic complaint is motivationally its a poor move - it starts a topic with failure. Which is a valid complaint, with students who freqently don't succeed this approach may not be so good.

But its success on learning outcomes is well documented.[1] Multi-choicers are particularly effective[1] Importantly commiting to an answer is key here. 

Why is this?
Maybe the correction effect - students remeber it better because the failure has made them less overly confident about a topic
Maybe its primed them to start making connections to other topics. The instruction then fills in the gaps. 
Maybe it perks interest - 

It possibly seems key is quick feedback on wrong answers. So people are corrected well.
